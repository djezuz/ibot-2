.. rubric:: my humble solution to the i.tv `robogames`_ challenge


Installation
============

This program comes with a traditional python setup.py file. Install it the
traditional way (idealling into a `virtualenv`_)::

    python setup.py install

Execution
=========

Run the program with no args to see the games one can try::

    ibot

Enjoy!
